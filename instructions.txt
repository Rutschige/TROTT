Once you have the necesary libraries installed, cd to the project
directory and run the following command:
python ./tracking_code/main.py

Once the program starts, use the mouse to select the area where the
object will be tracked. After that, drag your mouse over the object
you would like to track. After this, the program will begin active
tracking.
